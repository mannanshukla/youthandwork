        <h2>Envisioning Change:</h2>
        <p>Changes such as making the internet more accessible, having access to better education, and better infrastructure can positively affect the growth of youth in Africa. Starting with infrastructure, limited access to stable electricity and the internet can hinder access to educational resources or the many opportunities available online. Using resources to create or strengthen existing power lines can provide reliable electricity to the growing population and make the Internet more accessible. Making education more available and improving digital literacy are also factors that can positively impact the youth. Quality education is important for children to grow and thrive in this world, especially with the amount of competition there is. Africa is the continent with the highest youth population, with many young minds that are eager to learn but are unable to due to the lack of resources provided to them.             <br>
