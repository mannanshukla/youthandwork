        <h2>Campaign Ideas:</h2>
        <p>To further educate others about the challenges faced by young workers, specifically regarding the barriers young people face in accessing technology-driven opportunities. For the African youth in the youth labor market, the idea of moving away from a labor-driven economy to a technological economy appears unrealistic in the eyes of many, especially because most of these young people live in secluded areas that have yet to worry about post-colonial matters. As stated by the International Energy Agency for the year 2022, 600 million people, or 43% of the total population, lack access to electricity, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.  People use electricity for lighting, heating, cooling, refrigeration, machinery, and public transportation systems, this means that at least 43% of the African population does not get access to these basic needs, let alone access to the internet. According to the World Bank, in 2022 only 36% of Africa's population had broadband internet access. While the African population does not have access to these technological sources, some campaign ideas that can work on sharing this message will be documentaries that captivate individuals throughout the world and get the message across. I also believe that through the use of social media posts; such as TikTok, Instagram reels, and YouTube shorts, more people can become educated and can speak on behalf of those less fortunate. In this case the youth population in Africa. If they do not have access to the internet, let alone electricity they will continue to find themselves stuck in this vicious cycle of child labor.

            I think photography allows us consumers to have a clear picture of the situation at hand and allows individuals to be more conscious of who their money gets invested in. It can also help employers promote the inclusion of these low-income, low-resource areas and begin seeing how useful the youth can be for technologically advanced labor. Young workers instead of being a part of a physical labor market, will be able to take part in healthier lifestyles, while still earning an income with an online job overseas. With the help of artists that display their views through a creative outlet like the J. The Paul Getty Museum collection can have a long-lasting impact on the minds of people throughout the world and reach a greater audience. As a visual learner looking at an image or a video allows me to interpret and empathize with a situation rather than a piece of writing. Like myself, there are a lot of individuals who can better understand a circumstance when it is broken down into easier-to-digest information and when their key ideas are displayed.
