        <h2>Overview of Selected Topic</h2>
        <p>This research delves into how technological advancements impact employment opportunities for African youth. With the development of mobile internet, digital platforms, agricultural technology, and other technologies, new employment opportunities are emerging while also transforming existing job roles. We particularly focus on African countries or regions leading in technology-driven employment sectors, such as mobile financial services in Kenya and the startup tech ecosystem in Nigeria. By comparing these emerging employment opportunities for modern African youth with the labor experiences of American youth in industries like coal mining, manufacturing, and textiles in the 19th and early 20th centuries, we aim to reveal how technological advancements shape labor markets across different historical contexts, especially their impact on young workers.        </p>

        <h2>Reason for Selection:</h2>
        <p>The reason for choosing this topic lies in technology being not only a key driver of economic development and job creation, especially in regions like Africa with rapidly growing youth populations but also providing a unique perspective to examine and compare the labor experiences of youth across history and the contemporary era. Understanding the role of technology in shaping employment opportunities is crucial for addressing youth unemployment and underemployment. Furthermore, the significance of this topic lies in not only showcasing the potential of technology in creating job opportunities but also focusing on the challenges and barriers young people face in accessing these technology-driven opportunities. By exploring technological employment opportunities for African youth, we can better understand how public policies address inequalities in the youth labor market, especially against the backdrop of the current economic crisis, and how these experiences help us understand youth labor issues globally.
          <br>
          Through comparative analysis, we can also explore the impact of technology on education and career pathways, as well as how youth perceive their work and future careers. Particularly in the current economic recession environment, analyzing the experiences of young workers across different racial, class, and gender lines, and how various policies and projects improve their experiences and economic security, becomes central to this course. This in-depth analysis helps us understand how technology shapes the work and lives of youth globally from a comprehensive and comparative perspective, thus providing a theoretical and practical foundation for devising more effective policies and interventions.
