        <h2>Descriptive Information and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Globally, technology has played a crucial role in reshaping the employment landscape. This is due to its fast innovative speed. In this case, we will focus on the African nations. The adoption of mobile internet, innovative agricultural technologies, and digital platforms also indicated the transition from traditional labor markets to a technology-based market.  These changes also give young people a chance to participate in the digital economy. One of the cases mentioned in the overview was about mobile financial services which was the M-Pesa platform in Kenya. This platform gave local employment and entrepreneurial opportunities which was launched in 2007. M-Pesa allowed millions of local people to access financial services directly from their mobile phones (Leah Kiwara, 2018). This action helped local people with their major financial issues and opened more and more legal employment opportunities. As the M-Pesa started to operate, there were positions like M-Pesa agents who could operate in every corner of the country. Young people could apply for the position with a fair wage and workload. Meanwhile, the success of M-Pesa gives local young people the insight of being their own boss in Kenya. Many young people created applications and services that could address a wide range of financial needs. This has not only created more and more job opportunities but also brought light to the road of young people trying to build a business.
